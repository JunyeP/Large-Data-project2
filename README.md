## Question 4: Analysis

### BJKST vs Exact F0

The **BJKST algorithm** provides an excellent approximation of the number of distinct elements (F0) with a very small error margin of just **2.64%**. It achieves this accuracy with a compact bucket size of only **40**, making it very memory-efficient. Additionally, the time performance is impressive â€” only slightly slower than the exact calculation.

### Tug-of-War vs Exact F2

The **Tug-of-War algorithm** gives a good approximation of F2 (sum of squared frequencies) with an error of about **8.19%**. However, it is **significantly slower** than the exact computation, taking nearly **6 times longer** on the local machine and even more on GCP.
