## Question 4: Analysis

### BJKST vs Exact F0

The BJKST algorithm provides an excellent approximation of the number of distinct elements (F0) with a very small error margin of just 2.64%. The algorithm achieves this accuracy with a remarkably small bucket size of just 40, which is very memory-efficient. The time performance is also impressive - only slightly slower than the exact calculation.

### Tug-of-War vs Exact F2

The Tug-of-War algorithm provides a good approximation of F2 (sum of squared frequencies) with an error of about 8.19%. However, its runtime is significantly longer than the exact calculation, taking almost 6 times as long.
